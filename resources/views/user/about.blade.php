    <h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Application for the benefit of Self Help Groups .“Make in Punjab” is a platform to showcase various products created by Self Help Groups of Punjab. This initiative utilizes technology to enhance the visibility and marketability of the products created by small SHGs which hitherto were limited to the physical stalls of Craft Melas. Further, it will bridge the gap between the producer and the customer and provide information about the varied products to the customer sitting at home. The details of products of SHGs can be seen and booking orders can be made online. Further, the customers can directly contact the SHGs for more details.</p>
